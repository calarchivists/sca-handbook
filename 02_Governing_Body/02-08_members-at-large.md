# 2-8 Members at Large

## General Description

There are two non-officer Members who represent the membership at large on the SCA Board; each elected Member serves a term of two years. They serve staggered terms, as one is elected in even numbered years and the other is elected in odd numbered years.

It is the responsibility of Members to attend quarterly meetings of Board of Directors and to participate actively in the work of the Society and its committees. Specific duties and responsibilities may be assigned by the President.

The senior Member serves as the primary liaison to the WAI Joint Management Committee, while the junior Member (more recently elected) serves as the deputy liaison to the WAI Joint Management Committee during the second year of their term as Member.

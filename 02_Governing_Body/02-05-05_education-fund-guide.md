## Introduction: Education Fund

The SCA Board of Directors created the Education Fund as a restricted fund to which members may contribute donations, which are tax deductible. The Board is responsible for all aspects of administration of the Fund, including its expenditure. The Board shall exercise ordinary prudence in the Fundâ€™s management.

Spending Policy

Monies from the Fund shall be spent to increase the availability and affordability of professional education and training to SCA members. Monies from the Fund may only be used toward costs associated with educational workshops or training opportunities co- sponsored by SCA or other allied professional organizations.

This may include, but is not limited to:

- Direct costs of educational workshops, such as
  - instructor honorarium and travel costs
  - space and equipment needed to conduct the workshop
  - refreshments for attendees, etc.
- Indirect costs related to a workshop or required by a workshop contract, such as
  - costs of mailings, including postage
  - advertising
  - name badges, printed materials, and other documents
  - staffing costs
- Scholarships for SCA members attending SCA-sponsored workshops, including the Gray Scholarship
- Other appropriate and reasonable costs associated with professional education activities that benefit the membership

Expenditures should be considered in relation to these factors:
- The purposes of SCA and the Fund
- Duration and preservation of the Fund to carry out its purposes
- Overall, consistent strategy for the Fund
- Long-term sustainability of the Gray Scholarship
- Reach of the educational benefits to a significant number of members
- Other resources of SCA
- General economic conditions affecting SCA and the Fund

Withdrawals from the Fund shall not exceed 20 percent of the total funds reported on December 31 of the previous year.

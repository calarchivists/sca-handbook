## Points to cover
**Board**
- Members are elected, mostly 2 year terms, rotate which are new each year so that there are old and new hands
- Terms begin thirty (30) days after the annual business meeting
- Meets 4 times a year, fall meeting is the budget meeting
- Meetings are open
- VP/President-elect chairs the Program Committee, serves as President in second year of term, is ex officio for a third year and chairs Nominating Committee
- Directors at Large serve on the WAI Joint Management Committee

**Committees**
- Are mostly volunteer with chairs and members remaining as long their interest takes them, a few variations
  - LAC is just for the year
  - Nominating Committee is elected (Immediate Past President is chair and then two members elected in alternate years so there is always an old hand
and a new one)
  -Awards Committee members are appointed by President rather than
volunteers
- Some committees have a Northern and Southern co-chair, but the committee is one committee
  
**Orientation to SCA business**
- Familiarize yourself with the SCA Handbook
- Membership sends names of new and renewing members expressing interest in a specific committee--contact them, welcome them to your committee, involve them!
- Each committee chair prepares a formal report to the Board prior to each Board meeting. Make long enough to inform and alert the Board, but don’t feel you have
to reach a certain length. If there are issues, you should be communicating with your liaison in a more active way so they have the background.
- Keep committee members list current and fresh. If someone isn’t active, communicate with him/her, if no longer able/interested then don’t keep on the roll.
- Liaisons
  - Each committee has a liaison on the Board, usually determined at first meeting.
  - Liaison should communicate with their committee chair both before and after all Board meetings
  - Liaison should attempt to visit with the committee chair at least once during the AGM
  - Liaison should communicate budget information to the committee chair
  - Chair should check in with liaison particularly over issues with potential for conflict or difficulty
  - Make budget requests in the fall (can make special requests other times but...)
  - Committee chairs present an oral report of committee activity at the Annual Business Meeting (aka Members Meeting) during the AGM. Any chair unable to attend shall designate a representative to make this report.
  - Outgoing chairs should make a point of communicating with incoming chairs, review events and issues of the previous term
  - At minimum outgoing chairs or board liaisons should provide to incoming chairs copies of previous quarterly and annual reports and the previous year’s committee budget
  - Committee chairs send non-current records to the Society’s archives at the end of their term of service (or periodically in the case of long-term chairs)
  - The official SCA mailing address is at the State Archives in Sacramento, let the person in charge of the mailbox know your preferred address for mail forwarding
  - SCA has 2 retractable banners for use at meetings and outreach, the Outreach and Publicity chair(s) usually keep them

  
If a new chair, what questions do you have? If an experienced chair, what wisdom to impart?

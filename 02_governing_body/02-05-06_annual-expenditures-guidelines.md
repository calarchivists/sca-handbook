# 2-5-6 Guidelines for Annual Expenditures from the SCA General Fund

## Summary

Each fiscal year, the Board will use the following guidelines for determining annual expenditures from the SCA General Fund:
1. Maintain a reserve of approximately $47,000.
2. Identify Surplus General Funds, which are those in excess of the reserve of $47,000. Surplus funds should be calculated based on balances as of the previous January 1st.
3. Budget to expend 10 to 15 percent of surplus funds in the coming fiscal year.
4. Expend surplus General Funds in support of priorities identified by the Board and the most recent Strategic Planning Report.
5. Consider the availability of Restricted Funds when making General Fund expenditure decisions. If Restricted Funds are healthy, they should be used up to the maximum expenditure of principal permitted before drawing on General Funds; if Restricted Funds are depleted, then General Funds can be used.

These Guidelines are not binding, and may be modified according to the needs and financial health of the organization

## Calculating & Expending Surplus General Funds

### Introduction

In order to responsibly use SCA funds for programs and activities that benefit the Membership, each year the Board should budget to expend a percentage of accumulated surplus in the General Fund. The guidelines below are suggested to encourage the Board to identify and spend a percentage of surplus funds as part of the
annual budget process. The guidelines are not binding, and may be modified according to the needs and financial health of the organization.<sup>1</sup>

### Reserves
For the General Fund, surplus funds should be defined as those in excess of the minimal Operating Reserve, plus an AGM Reserve sufficient to cover the liability defined in the current hotel contract.

The Operating Reserve has been $12,000, as adopted by the Board based on 2002 recommendation by the Finance and Investment Committee. It is intended as a cash reserve sufficient to cover six months of expenses.

The recommended “AGM Reserve” should be sufficient to cover a worst case scenario: cancellation of the AGM. The AGM hotel contract is SCA’s largest financial commitment each year. For 2014, the cancellation cost is the cost of the room block we have committed to fill, plus the minimum catering cost projected: ( {160 rooms @ $148} + $5,000 catering = $28,680). Other recent AGM hotel contracts have had a slightly higher obligation, therefore a $35,000 AGM Reserve is recommended. (The Board may adjust this in light of current contract details, but it serves as a good base figure.)

Based on 2013-2014 figures, $47,000 is the target reserve ($12,000 Operating Reserve + $35,000 AGM Reserve), and General Funds in excess of this should be used for SCA programs and member benefits.

### Surplus Funds

In preparation for each year’s budgeting, the surplus General Funds should be calculated based on balances as of the previous January 1st. The Board should budget to expend 10% to 15% of surplus funds in the coming fisal year, so that any programs funded will be sustainable for several years to come.

Example calculations based on 2014 budgeting figures are: 

| General Fund as of Jan. 2013: | $160,000 |
| Operating Reserve: | - $12,000 |
| AGM Reserve: | - $35,000 |
| --------  | -------- |
| Surplus General Funds: | $113,000 |

10% of 113,000 = $11,300

15% of 113,000 = $16,950

Therefore the 2014 budget target should be roughly $11,000 to $17,000 “in the red”, with this sum directly underwriting programs or other member benefits.

### Expenditures

Expenditures ideally should support activities emphasized in the most recent Strategic Planning Report, but may support other priorities identified by the Board. For example, based on the four recommendations of the 2013 Strategic Planning Report, the types of expenses that should gradually spend down surplus funds should result in
a) expanded educational and networking opportunities for members, through regional programming
b) enhanced or increased educational opportunities
c) improved communication among the membership and with allied professions and organizations
d) reduced workload for SCA volunteers that administer programs and activities (most likely through clerical or administrative assistance and/or tools that lead to increased efficiency.)

General Fund expenditure decisions should be made in light of available Restricted Funds each year as well. If the Education Fund is healthy and can support increased educational programming or scholarships, it should be used up to the maximum expenditure of principal permitted before the General Fund is applied to educational programs. Similarly, if the Speakers Fund is healthy or depleted, the General Fund may be spared or tapped to support speaker expenses as appropriate.

<sup>1</sup>_If an administrator or clerical assistant is hired, for example, the budget situation will
change dramatically and the recommended calculations below will not be sufficient._

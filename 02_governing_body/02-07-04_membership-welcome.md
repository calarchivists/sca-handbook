Dear new SCA member,

Welcome to the Society of California Archivists, and thank you for your membership! As you know, SCA is an active regional organization that provides quality programs and publications to educate and enrich the activities of archivists, manuscript curators, records managers, librarians, historians, and other individuals committed to the preservation and use of our documentary heritage.

As a member, you will have access to the SCA _Newsletter_ via the SCA web site, which will help you keep abreast of news of interest to archivists in the state. You will also be invited to attend fall and spring programs, the SCA Annual General Meeting, and the Western Archives Institute. These meetings and workshops alternate geographically between the northern and southern areas of the state for the convenience of our far-flung membership. Please check our web site at [https://www.calarchivists.org](https://www.calarchivists.org) for updated information and schedules. Also, do plan now for the 2010 Annual General Meeting that will be held April 29-May 1, 2009 in Seattle, Washington. This annual meeting will combine the memberships of the Society of California Archivists, Association of Hawaii Archivists (AHA), Conference of Inter-Mountain Archivists (CIMA), Northwest Archivists (NWA), and Society of Rocky Mountain Archivists (SRMA). Stay tuned for details as to the exact venue and program.

Since October 2008, SCA has posted the Society’s Newsletter and Membership Roster on the SCA web site. The _Newsletter_ is freely accessible, but a user name and password are required to access the _Membership Roster_. The following user name and password will provide access: User name = roster; password = sca_r0$ter (that's a zero, not a capital O). Sent along with this letter you will also find instructions for subscribing to West_Arch, the Western archivist's e-mail listserv and an order form for the “Preserving Your History Brochure Series.”

I would like to invite you to join one of SCA’s working committees, which constitute the engine that drives our Society. I think you will find that SCA’s various committees not only provide valuable services to the archival community, but provide those who actively get involved rewarding educational and networking opportunities. You can find contact information for the various committee chairs on the SCA web site or in the _Newsletter_.

Again, welcome. If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me, or any of the SCA Board members or committee chairs. We look forward to seeing or hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Laura O’Hara

President

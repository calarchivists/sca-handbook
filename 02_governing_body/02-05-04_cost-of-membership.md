# 2-5-4 Cost of Membership

Programs and benefits provided by the Society are divided into two categories: membership benefits and membership electives.

Membership benefits are those services and products generated by the Society, and received automatically by every member. Membership electives are those self-supporting programs and services, such as publications, workshops, and the annual meeting, of which members may choose to partake. Membership benefits are meant to be supported through annual dues, and electives through fees.

The budgetary items comprising the cost of membership figure include the Newsletter, administration, and Board and committee expenses.

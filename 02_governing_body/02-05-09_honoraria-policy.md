# 2-5-9 Honoraria Policy

The Society of California Archivists (SCA) strongly supports the use of special speakers at the Annual General Meeting, Society sponsored workshops, Western Archives Institute and other special events. In recognition of the effort and preparation time required of speakers and instructors, the following policy has been adopted for use:

1. AGM special speakers (i.e. keynote, plenary, or luncheon guest speakers) will be offered an honorarium at the time of initial contact. Those individuals who decline the honorarium will be informed of the option of returning the funds to the Society as a tax-deductible donation. AGM speakers who receive an honorarium from the SCA Speakers Fund will be compensated at a rate approved by the Board. This amount may vary depending on the speaker as negotiated by the Program Chair. AGM keynote, plenary, and other special speakers not funded by the SCA Speakers Fund, will receive an honorarium of a specified amount (see table) unless other rates or expenses are approved by the Board. The Board will periodically review the amounts.

2. Society sponsored workshop instructors will be offered an honorarium at the time of initial contact. The honorarium will be a specified amount (see table) periodically reviewed by the Board. Those individuals who decline the honorarium will be informed of the option of returning the funds to the Society as a tax deductible donation. The honorarium costs will be recouped from fees charged to attend the workshop.

3. Western Archives Institute (WAI) principal faculty and adjunct faculty will be offered an honorarium at the time of initial contact. The honorarium will be a specified amount (see table) periodically reviewed by the Board. Those individuals who decline the honorarium will be informed of the option of returning the funds to the WAI as a tax deductible donation. The honorarium costs will be a part of the overall budget for each WAI.

4. Western Archives Institute Associate Administrator and On-site Coordinator will be offered an honorarium at the time of initial contact. The honorarium will be a specified amount (see table) periodically reviewed by the Board. Those ndividuals who decline the honorarium will be informed of the option of returning the funds to the WAI as a tax-deductible donation. The honorarium costs will be a part of the overall budget for each WAI.

5. In cases of special circumstances or events, Committee Chairs can bring proposals for additional honoraria funds to the Board for consideration.

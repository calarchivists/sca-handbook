# 1-9-6 SCA Archives

## Finding Aid
The SCA Archives are held by Special Collections at the University of California, Santa Barbara. An EAD version of the finding aid is made available on the Online Archive of California (OAC) at [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt158033bd/](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt158033bd/). This version of the finding aid was accessed in May 2011.

## History
SCA approved a resolution on December 3, 1976 establishing the SCA Archives and designating UCLA Special Collections as the repository. The SCA Archives collection was established by Anne Caiger, head of Special Collections at the University Research Library of UCLA with the first transfer of records in 1976 and 1977. Anne was an early member of the society and served as president from 1979-1980. James Mink, the first president of SCA, was also from UCLA. Due to the strong UCLA/SCA connection in the formative years of the society, it was a natural outgrowth that the archives be under the care and supervision of the University's Special Collections department. The SCA Archives collection was actually stored in the University of California's Southern Regional Storage Facility. By agreement with SCA, UCLA and Special Collections at UCSB, the archives were formally transferred to UCSB Special Collections in the mid-1990s. A gift agreement between UCSB and SCA Archives was signed in October 2019; the Secretary retains a copy of the gift agreement.

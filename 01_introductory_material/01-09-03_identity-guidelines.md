# SCA Identity Guidelines

These Identity Guidelines are intended to help board members, committee chairs, and others developing creative content for SCA maintain graphic continuity on our website, in the SCA Newsletter, and in other print and online applications. The logo, letterhead, and other files can be downloaded from the “Members Only” section of the SCA website.

## Logos
The SCA logo can be included on internal and external communications. The logo is available with blue, white, and transparent backgrounds in numerous file formats.

### Color Logos
The color logo should be used whenever possible, especially on the website, the newsletter, and professionally printed materials like official signage and AGM programs.

### Black/White Logo
The black/white logo can be used on stationary or in other contexts where color is not feasible or desirable.

## Typography

### Headline
Aller is used for the "SCA" and "Society of California Archivists" text in the logo. It should primarily be used for headlines, has a free license, and is available for download from the “Members Only” section of the SCA website.

### Body Copy
Georgia and Helvetica should be used for body copy in print and online.

The use of Georgia can impart a classic and formal look, but the serifs can also be difficult to read in some applications.

The use of Helvetica can impart a modern and clean look, but Helvetica can also look plain in some design contexts.

## Letterhead
SCA's letterhead can be printed in color or black/white. Templates for both versions can be downloaded from the “Members Only” section of the SCA website.

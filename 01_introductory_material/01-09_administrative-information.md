# 1-9 Administrative Information

The master copy of the Society of California Archivists Handbook, maintained by the Secretary, exists in an online format on the SCA website. All Board decisions affecting material in it should be immediately noted by the Secretary. These revisions should be made and updated in the master online copy of the Handbook so that all board members, committee chairs, and the general membership may have access to the most current version.

A printed version of the Handbook should also be maintained by the Secretary, and a printed copy of each outdated or superseded section sent to the SCA Archives.

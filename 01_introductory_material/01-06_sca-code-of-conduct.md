# 1-6 SCA Code of Conduct

The Society of California Archivists (SCA) is devoted to fostering cooperation and professional development among its members. SCA is committed to providing its members and guests with a welcoming, diverse, and professional community. SCA does not tolerate harassment in any form. The Code of Conduct is meant to ensure that those who participate in SCA Programs[^1] will not be harassed or in turn harass someone else for any reason. All members and guests are entitled to participate in a professional environment regardless of age, color, creed, disability, family relationship, gender identity, gender expression, individual lifestyle, level of experience in the archival field, marital status, military or veteran status, national origin, physical appearance, professional status, race, class, religion, sex, or sexual orientation.

SCA is committed to combating implicit and explicit bias, and dismantling structural inequities, such as white supremacy, patriarchy, classism, heteronormativity, and ableism. The SCA community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. 

We believe that the best problem-solving and critical thinking happens when people with a wide variety of experiences and perspectives come together to work in comfort as peers. We, therefore, expect participants in the SCA community to help create thoughtful and respectful environments where dialogue and exchange can take place. This policy is not intended to constrain responsible scholarly or professional discourse and debate, but to foster an environment where it can thrive in a universally welcoming community setting. 

SCA will take seriously all good-faith reports of harassment. Harassment may include, but is not limited to, abusive verbal or written comments, unwelcome jokes, discriminatory images, and/or purposeful acts of misgendering in public or online spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact or invasion of physical space; unwelcome sexual attention; and comments that reinforce oppressive power dynamics related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin, or economic status.

Participants in any SCA event or forum, online or offline, who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Those who violate these rules are subject to expulsion from the program or online space. Persons who have been expelled, banned, or otherwise denied access may submit an appeal to the SCA Board.[^2]

[^1] SCA Programs include conferences, workshops, events, meetings, formal mentoring relationships, and online spaces such as the West_Arch listserv. 
[^2] The SCA Code of Conduct is reassessed every three years.

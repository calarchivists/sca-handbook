# 1-8 SCA Photography Policy

The Society of California Archivists (SCA) reserves the right to use any photograph or video taken at any event sponsored by SCA without the expressed written permission of those included within the photograph or video. Photographs or videos may be used in programs, brochures,
newsletters, websites, social media, etc. for promotional purposes.

A person attending an SCA-sponsored event who does not wish to have their image captured for distribution should make their wishes known to the photographer and the event organizers, and notify SCA at c/o California State Archives, 1020 “O” Street, Sacramento, CA 95814 in writing of their intentions and supply a photograph for reference. SCA will treat the photo as confidential and will use it for identification purposes only.

To ensure the privacy of individuals and children, images will not be identified using names or personal identifying information without written approval from the photographed subject, parent or legal guardian. Board members, committee members, and any other individuals serving in an official capacity for SCA automatically consent to being identified in images or video that contain their likeness.

By participating in an SCA-sponsored event or by failing to notify SCA in writing about your desire to not have your photograph used by SCA, you are agreeing to release, defend, hold harmless and indemnify SCA from any and all claims involving the use of your picture or likeness.

Any person or organization not affiliated with SCA may not use, copy, alter or modify SCA photographs, graphics, videography or other, similar reproductions or recordings without the advance written permission of an authorized designee from SCA.

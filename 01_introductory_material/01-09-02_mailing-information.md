# 1-9-2 Mailing Information

## Permanent Mailing ADdress

Society of California Archivists

c/o California State Archives

1020 “O” Street

Sacramento, CA 95814

## General Description and Use
The address noted above serves as a permanent mailing address for the Society.

The address should be used as the _postal return address_ for the SCA Newsletter, workshop fliers, membership brochures, and other Society publications, brochures, and other mailings.

Membership inquiries and applications (not membership renewals), exchange newsletters, and other general correspondence and communications should be directed to this address. Mail will be sorted and forwarded to the appropriate individuals.

Mail intended for specific officers, Board of Directors members, and committee chairs should continue to be addressed to those individuals, _not the permanent mailing address_, unless the current office holder or chair is not known.

Registration for workshops, the Annual General Meeting, and other Society events; newsletter submissions; membership renewal notices, ballots; surveys; and similar mailings should be addressed to the responsible Committee chair or designee, not the permanent mailing address.

## Management of the Permanent Address
A staff member of the California State Archives (CSA) will manage the permanent address. The CSA staff member serves at the pleasure of the Society’s Board of Directors; therefore the Board needs to be kept informed as to who is serving in this capacity.

SCA reimburses the CSA manager for all expenses incurred in the fulfillment of the responsibilities described below. Expenses include postage, stationery, photocopying, mailing labels, telephone calls, and rubber stamps.

## Responsibilities
1. Checks the SCA mail box at least twice a week and acts on the contents in a timely manner. Time dated or urgent materials should be forwarded immediately. Membership forms and publication orders may be accumulated and forwarded weekly. Advertisements, junk mail, and oddities may be forwarded or discarded, at the discretion of the manager. Other mailings are forwarded to SCA officers, directors, committee chairs and/or newsletter editor as appropriate.
2. Responds to general inquiries regarding SCA, provides membership information/brochures when requested and directs inquiries to the appropriate board, chair, or committee member.
3. Contacts the Membership Director to check on and correct member contact information (address or phone number) when SCA mailings are returned as undeliverable from the post office. If mailing information can be corrected forwards mail when possible.
4. Provides itemized list of expenses, with receipts as possible, to the Treasurer, using the request for reimbursement form. The Treasurer will include this expense as a separate item in reports to the Board of Directors.

## Change of Address
Members are responsible for informing SCA of any change of address. Returned mailings will not be forwarded unless a new address is provided by the post office on the returned item. SCA
is not responsible for determining new address unless informed by members. Change of address information will be forwarded to the Membership Director.

## Foreign Mailings
SCA mailings (e.g. newsletter, workshop announcements, etc.) to foreign destinations must be placed in an envelope to assure proper delivery, otherwise they will be returned by the post office.

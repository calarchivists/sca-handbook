# 4-1-3-1 Archival Award of Excellence

## Description

Co-sponsored by the Society of California Archivists and the California Historical Records Advisory Board (CHRAB), the Archival Award of Excellence honors individuals in California who have made an outstanding contribution to the archives profession and accomplished exceptional work in the archives and records management field. These contributions include activities such as contributing innovative or creative ideas to the profession, improving the profession's effectiveness through advocacy or services, or promoting greater public awareness of archives and the archival profession. Nominees must have accomplished the work within the state of California during the five-year period preceding the year in which the award is presented.

The Archival Award of Excellence (formerly the Archivist Award of Excellence) was established in 1989 by the California Heritage Preservation Commission, an advisory body to the California State Archives, which identified a need to recognize outstanding work done within the state. The Archival Award of Excellence is presented at the Awards Ceremony at the Annual General Meeting of the Society of California Archivists.

Nomination forms for the award are distributed and received by the California State Archives and reviewed by CHRAB.

SCAâ€™s role as a co-sponsor includes the financial commitment to producing the award.

## Criteria
Nominees must have worked with materials that are primarily related to California; must have performed work that is clearly identified as archival, record or manuscript related; and must have completed it within the past five years.

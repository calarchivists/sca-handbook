# 4-1 External Relations and Affinity Groups

## Description

SCA may, when needed and as appropriate, develop external relations with allied organizations and appoint representatives to other committees and boards so that the Society may have a voice in projects and activities within the greater archival and historical records community. Examples of such allied organizations and events include: California Historical Records Advisory Board (CHRAB), California Archives Month Management Committee, Journal of Western Archives, Society of American Archivists (SAA), and special regional archival meetings such as the Western Round-up.

Affinity Groups may also be formed within SCA to provide members with an opportunity to discuss a common archival collecting focus, format, or function.

When appropriate, SCA may also provide meeting space for allied organizations, other committees and boards, or affinity groups at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) when space is available and when costs are not detrimental to the Society.

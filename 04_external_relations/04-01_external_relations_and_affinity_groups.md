# Part 4: External Relations

## 4-1 External Relations and Affinity Groups

**Description**

SCA may, when needed and as appropriate, develop external relations with allied organizations and appoint representatives to other committees and boards so that the Society may have a voice in projects and activities within the greater archival and historical records community. Examples of such allied organizations and events include: California Historical Records Advisory Board (CHRAB), California Archives Month Management Committee, Journal of Western Archives, Society of American Archivists (SAA), and special regional archival meetings such as the Western Round-up.

Affinity Groups may also be formed within SCA to provide members with an opportunity to discuss a common archival collecting focus, format, or function.

When appropriate, SCA may also provide meeting space for allied organizations, other committees and boards, or affinity groups at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) when space is available and when costs are not detrimental to the Society.

## 4-1-1 Affinity Groups

**Description**

According to the Articles of Incorporation, the purpose of the Society of California Archivists is to “support and sponsor educational programs and other activities to encourage and advocate the identification, collection, preservation, use and appreciation of historic records and manuscripts.” The five objectives listed in the 1997 Bylaws call for SCA to act as a vehicle for dissemination of information about archival collections and issues, provide a forum for discussion, develop and support archival education programs, cooperate with individuals and other organizations on matters of common concern, as well as advocate historical records as listed in the purpose. Affinity Groups formed within SCA help to fulfill the purpose and objectives of the Society

1. An Affinity Group is defined as a group that forms around a common archival collecting focus (i.e., religious archives) or format (i.e., audiovisual collections), and which exists to provide networking and educational opportunities.
2. Though recognized by SCA as an integral entity which works toward the fulfillment of the Society’s purpose, an Affinity Group is not a committee of SCA. Groups will not have Chairs appointed by the SCA President, nor be included in SCA’s budget.
3. SCA may provide Affinity Groups meeting time and space at the Annual General Meeting. Non-SCA members will not need to register if they attend only the Affinity Group meeting, but will be required to pay appropriate registration fees if they attend any other function other than the Affinity Group meeting (i.e., sessions and workshops).
4. When an Affinity Group is formed, notice should be given to the SCA Board of Directors. The Secretary will list groups by name (and dates when known) in this section.
5. Affinity Groups will be responsible for:
   a. Their own organization, however formal or informal they choose to be.
   b. Deciding how to choose their leadership and membership.
   c. Meetings (other than at the AGM) or activities they may wish to have, deciding their frequency, location, purpose, and content.
   d. Developing and maintaining group mailing lists and for informing their membership of meetings or activities.
   e. Conducting all group business, including assessing and handling any fees. Groups must adhere to the stipulations of SCA Articles of Incorporation concerning the 501(c)3 status of a nonprofit public benefit corporation.

## 4-1-2 Archives Month

**Description**

Archives Month is an opportunity for libraries, museums, government archives, historical societies, corporate archives, and related institutions to plan public programs to highlight the importance and value of historic records and archival materials.

In the state of California, Archives Month is typically observed throughout October and is jointly sponsored by a coordinating committee, the California Archives Month Statewide Coordinating Committee (CAMSCC), made up of representatives from the Society of California Archivists (SCA), the California Historical Records Advisory Board (CHRAB), the California State Archives (CSA), and the National Archives and Records Administration – Pacific Region (NARA). The organizations that make up CAMSCC, appoint individuals to serve on the CAMSCC Working Group which is tasked with producing the Archives Month poster.

## 4-1-3 California Historical Records Advisory Board

**Description**

The California Historical Records Advisory Board (CHRAB) was established in 1976 in response to federal regulations that require each state to have a historical records board in order to participate in the grant funding program of the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC). As the central advisory body for historical records in California, CHRAB is authorized to carry out statewide planning and assessment activities, act as a coordinator to facilitate cooperation among historical record-keepers within the state, and serve as a state-level reviewer of NHPRC grant applications.

The CHRAB is composed of a state coordinator, appointed by the Governor, a deputy coordinator, and eleven additional members. Representatives from the California State Library, California Department of Parks and Recreation, Society of California Archivists, California Association of Museums, and California Conference for the Promotion of History serve on the board. In addition, there are members representing universities and colleges, local governments, and the records management community. Three at-large members complete the board. A majority of the members must have demonstrated experience or interest in the collection, administration, and use of historical records.

In partnership with NHPRC, the CHRAB works to serve the needs of California constituencies involved in the management and preservation of historical records. Under federal regulations, the Board has two principal roles:
1. Acts as coordinating body for historical record activities statewide
2. Reviews NHPRC grants from California organizations and makes recommendations to the National Commission.

**SCA’s Role**

The SCA President appoints a representative to serve on CHRAB.
SCA also co-sponsors an award with CHRAB, the Archival Award of Excellence.

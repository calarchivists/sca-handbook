# 3-11-1 Vice Chair for Member Activities

## General Description

The Vice Chair for Member Activities will serve on the Membership Committee. This volunteer position will coordinate member-initiated events, assist in the development of local or regional social networking chapters within the Society of California Archivists (SCA), and act as the contact for event planners or chapters within SCA.

Member-initiated events may be proposed and organized by individual member volunteers, or by informal local chapters of SCA. Chapter development will be determined by the concentration of members in a designated geographic area, and local interest. Regional chapters will be encouraged to form with the goal of organizing and carrying out local events. Events may include social gatherings that are structured or unstructured, planned or spontaneous, as members see fit. Activities can include gatherings at local restaurants, museums, and other recreational venues. More structured professional development events with speakers or panels may also be presented, with support as outlined in SCA’s Member-Initiated Events program.

The Vice Chair for Member Activities will serve as the contact person for any member or regional chapter that wants to organize a local event with SCA support. The Vice Chair will forward proposals or enquiries to the Board, communicate between the Board and local organizers, and maintain brief records and reports regarding sponsored events.

The Vice Chair for Member Activities is appointed by the Membership Director and approved by the President.

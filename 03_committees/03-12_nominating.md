# 3-12 Nominating Committee

## General Description

The Nominating Committee solicits candidates for the SCA Board of Directors and prepares a slate of candidates for offices falling vacant within a given year.

The three member committee is chaired by the Immediate Past President. The procedure for selection of the Nominated Committee members and terms of office are described in Bylaws IV.3, IV.5, IV.6, and VII.3.

## Responsibilities

General responsibilities are outlined in Handbook section 3-1.

1. Discuss responsibilities, procedures, and possible candidates as a committee in the fall.
2. Solicits suggestions of potential candidates from the membership via the Newsletter, the web site, listervs, and emails to the membership.
3. Consults candidate suggestions received from membership, along with suggestions received over the preceding two (2) years, so that three (3) years of suggested names are considered by the Committee in preparing the slate of candidates. The outgoing Chair of the Nominating Committee is to pass to the incoming Chair the collected list of names suggested and the various forms (nominating, candidate statements) to be updated each year for the current Committee’s use. Nominating Committee members may also propose names of candidates, and the Board should also be informally consulted for a list of suggested potential candidates.
4. Contacts potential nominees, explains to them the duties and terms of office for which they are being considered; is prepared to answer questions potential nominees may have, and allows adequate time for the potential nominees to arrive at a decision to run. Refers nominees to Handbook for description of officer duties.
5. Selects candidates considering the following:

a. Try to ensure that both the northern and southern regions of the state are represented by at least one (1) Board member
 
b. Solicit candidates from as wide a variety of membership interests as possible, such as large and small institutions, archives and manuscripts collections, and public and private institutions.

c. Confirm membership status of potential candidates with Membership Director. Candidates must be current members. (See also item 9 below, for guidelines.)

6. Requests a statement of intent or poses a question that must be answered by each Board candidate. Candidates’ responses to the questions will be forwarded with the ballots to the membership. Examples of sample questions:

a. President: In what direction do you see the Society moving in the next decade? What role should the Society play on a statewide and national basis?

b. Board of Directors: What are your immediate concerns about the Society, and what projects would you like to see accomplished during your term? How might we structure the Society to encourage increased member involvement?

c. Treasurer or Secretary: What skills do you possess that are particularly applicable to the position?

d. All positions: Please detail your efforts to integrate equity and inclusion practices into your work and any plans you may have for this as [position title].

7. Sends each candidate a candidate statement form to be completed and returned (Handbook 3-11-2).

8. Prepares the slate of candidates and sends it, along with candidate biographical forms and statements, to the Election Committee by January 31st. In preparing the slate, the following points should be kept in mind:

a. If possible, more than one (1) candidate should be listed for each office.

b. The office of President should not be listed as an elective position. The Vice President automatically succeeds the President after one year.

# 3-10-5 LAC Compensation Guidelines

## General Description

The Local Arrangements Committee (LAC) is responsible for all Annual General Meeting (AGM) physical arrangements, including the hotel contract, meeting spaces, catering, A/V contract/logistics, allied event venues, online/on-site registration, publicity, tours, and post-AGM wrap-up/evaluation. 

LAC is arguably the most labor-intensive committee within SCA, requiring an immense amount of work by the co-chairs and their committee members over a twelve-month period. There is a steep learning curve for the LAC co-chairs, and the role requires a level of commitment and aptitude far beyond what is typically required of other SCA committee chairs. LAC co-chairs/members also devote a considerable amount of their time onsite at the AGM to ensuring that the event runs smoothly and successfully.

As an organization committed to fair and equitable labor practices, SCA is committed to compensating LAC for their contributions to the AGM by providing financial assistance with registration fees, travel costs, and hotel accommodations.

## Compensation Guidelines
- Any and all compensation is at the discretion of the Board and based on the availability of funds.
- Compensation is only available if these AGM-related expenses are not already covered by the LAC memberâ€™s employer.
- Compensation is delivered in the form of waived/reduced fees and reimbursement for approved costs; direct financial compensation will not be provided.

### LAC Co-chair (Senior/Junior only) Compensation:
- AGM full registration fees will be waived
- Reimbursement of up to $300 for travel to/from the AGM
- Comped room night(s) at the AGM host hotel (based on the availability of comped rooms allotted through the AGM hotel contract)

### LAC Committee Member (Registration) Compensation:
- AGM full registration fees will be waived

### LAC Committee Member (All others) Compensation:
- AGM full registration fee will be discounted up to $100
- Total discount for all other committee members combined shall not exceed $1,000 and will be distributed evenly amongst the committee

### LAC Registration Desk Volunteer Compensation:
- Free one-year individual membership to SCA for volunteers serving on the registration desk at the AGM for at least three hours.

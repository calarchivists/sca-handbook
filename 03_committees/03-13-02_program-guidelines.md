# 3-13-2 AGM Program Committee Guidelines

Generally, the Program Committee is not inundated by SCA members with proposals for AGM topics and speakers. Usually, the committee must brainstorm topics, discuss possible speakers, and then engage speakers. Finally, the committee delivers the set program and all its details to the Local Arrangements Committee, which arranges the distribution and printing of the AGM printed program and related materials.

The Program Committee Chair must guide these activities, set clear responsibility and deadlines, and inform Local Arrangements of anticipated program needs. No later than one month before the AGM, the committee chair makes sure that committee members have confirmed all meeting and session details with their speakers and that the speakers have informed the committee of all AV needs and, where appropriate, lunch plans.

Some committee activities, such as brainstorming, deciding on the broad themes of the AGM, and scheduling sessions, require committee meetings. Other activities, such as following up "leads" for speakers, determining the topics of each speaker, and verifying AGM information, can be done by telephone or email. Although in-person committee meetings are ideal, past committees have also met via teleconference or electronically.

## Policies and procedures

It is SCA policy to offer non-member speakers complimentary registration for the entire AGM. This does not include workshops, materials fees, or events with extra fees such as luncheons. No one has to register just to speak, but members must register if they are attending other sessions or events. In addition, SCA pays for lunch for the keynote speaker, luncheon speakers, and recipients of awards as noted in the Awards Committee section. However, the Program Committee Chair may draw from their discretionary fund to cover luncheon costs for special guests.

Generally, the Board approves a set dollar amount for discretionary use by the Program Committee Chair, and it becomes a line item under the Program Committee’s budget.

The Program Committee may use monies from the Society’s SCA Speakers Fund to help pay for honoraria and travel expenses to bring in keynote or luncheon speakers. Consultation with the Treasurer and the Board is encouraged to determine how much may be allocated in a given year.

The Program Committee and the Local Arrangements Committee need to stay in close contact right from the beginning, but especially as the AGM draws near. Local Arrangements will need to know the number and type of sessions planned so they can make meeting room arrangements. They will need exact, detailed session and speaker information to print in the AGM printed program. They must be informed of speakers' AV requirements well in advance.

Program Committee members should use the "Session Proposal Form" as a tool for insuring that they obtain complete, detailed information on each session, speaker, and AV needs.
 
Each session should have a Program Committee liaison/facilitator in addition to the session chair/moderator/commentator to take care of logistical details and help the session run smoothly. If the chair wishes, the facilitator can also write an evaluation of the session and a summary of the session for the SCA _Newsletter_.

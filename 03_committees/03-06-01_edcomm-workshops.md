# 3-6-1 Education Committee Workshops

## General Description

The Education Committee develops and presents archival education workshops to be sponsored by SCA. These workshops are generally:

1. regional fall programs—one Northern, one Southern
2. spring programs—alternating Northern and Southern in the opposite region of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) location
3. specialized workshops to be offered as opportunities present themselves or as demand requires

The topics for the workshops are determined by the Committee based on input from the membership and opportunity. It is recommended that a basic archival workshop be offered from time to time.

## Basic Archival Workshop

It is recommended that this workshop be co-taught by an archivist working with public records and an archivist working with historical manuscripts. The workshop should address three major questions:

1. What are archives and manuscripts and why are they important?
2. How do we preserve and make them available?
3. What is needed to create an archival program?

Among the topics discussed are: archival principals and methodology, developing a collection policy, relationship between archives and records management, selecting an archivist, donor relations, legal issues, planning programs of arrangement and description, access policy, security, conservation concerns, facilities management, financial resources, outreach. (Note: This workshop is not a practicum on how to arrange and describe records.)

## Planning

### Site Selection & Local Arrangements for Regional Workshops
- Select a (preferably free) site that has sufficient parking and preferably one with good public transit options.
- Site selection physical considerations: Is the site wheelchair accessible? Is there an elevator people can take instead of stairs? Is the site heated/air conditioned? Is there much noise outside the meeting room? Water fountains or bottle filling stations? Where are the power outlets? Does the site provide power strips, or do you need to bring them?
- Refreshments: Does the site have a coffeemaker? Do you have to bring in refreshments, napkins, cups, etc.? Are you obligated to use the site's catering service? If using a catering service, be aware of extra "set up" and "linens" charges which may apply. Will food/beverages be provided in the same room where the workshop is being held or in an adjacent location? Are there vegetarian or vegan options available? If the workshop has a lunch break, where are local eateries for participants to go to, or places to sit and eat packed lunches?
- Work with the site host to prepare onsite directional signage as needed, or as the site allows.

### Site Selection & Local Arrangements for AGM or Western Archivists Meeting Workshops
- Education Committee should coordinate with the Local Arrangements Committee to identify space at the conference site (site cost will be absorbed by the Local Arrangements Committee).
- Site selection physical considerations: Is the site wheelchair accessible? Is there an elevator people can take instead of stairs? Is the site heated/air conditioned? Is there much noise outside the meeting room? Water fountains or bottle filling stations? Where are the power outlets? Does the site provide power strips, or do you need to bring them?
- Refreshments: The Education Committee should work with the Local Arrangements Committee to place orders for breaks at the conference site (cost of breaks will be absorbed by the Education Committee). If the workshop has a lunch break, it is helpful to be able to recommend local eateries or places to sit to eat packed lunches.
- Work with Local Arrangements Committee to prepare onsite directional signage as needed, or as the site allows.

### Relevant to Both Regional and AGM or Western Archivists Meeting Workshops

**Speakers**
- Some speakers need official requests to speak as documentation for their own supervisors.
- Committee is responsible for any travel and/or lodging arrangements needed by the speaker. Travel and lodging expenses will be reimbursed using Education Committee funds per the current Board Handbook reimbursement policy.
- See Rate Table in Honoraria Policy Section 2-5-9 for current honoraria. Special cases can always be presented to the Board.
- Try to have your speakers scheduled and on board as soon as possible. If you approach a potential speaker who is unable to participate, ask that person if he/she can recommend another person to speak on that topic.
- Don't forget to thank the speaker(s) after the workshop has taken place.
Scheduling
Select the day that works for you, the site, and your key speakers, then work back. Be aware of scheduling the workshop so that it does not conflict with other conferences or meetings. Scheduling workshops too late in December can make it difficult to submit reimbursement forms before the year is over. See Section 3-6-2 for a task timeline.

**Publicity**
- Confirm spelling of names, titles, and institutions of speakers for publicity.
- Confirm maps and parking/public transportation directions.
- Send workshop information to the SCA Newsletter editor.
- Create the online registration page. Make sure to include any information necessary for full workshop participation (personal laptops required, any knowledge or previous experience required to get the most out of the workshop topic).
- Post workshop details to "Upcoming Workshops" page on SCA website. After workshop is run, move an abbreviated workshop description to the "Past Workshops" page.

- Help in Advance of the Workshop:
  - Setting up online registration and answering registration questions.

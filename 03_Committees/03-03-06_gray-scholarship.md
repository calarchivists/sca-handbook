# 3-3-6 Walter P. Gray III Education Fund Scholarship and Guidelines

## Introduction: Walter P. Gray III Scholarship
The SCA Education Committee established the scholarship to provide tuition and travel support for SCA members in good standing to attend educational programs offered statewide or online. The scholarship is named in memory of Walter P. Gray III, former California State Archivist. In formulating this scholarship, similar continuing education scholarship programs were reviewed, including those offered by other regional archival organizations.

## Guidelines
1. _The intent of the scholarship_ is to promote professional development of SCA members and allow them to attend archives-focused training in California or online. The training can be offered by either SCA or organizations not affiliated with SCA. The award is for up to $500 per individual for a single educational event, with a total annual expenditure limit of $2,000. Recipients may use the funds for workshop fees, travel, food and lodging.
2. _Publicity_: For SCA-sponsored events, notice of scholarship availability will be publicized in conjunction with the educational event in SCA publications, on the SCA website, and to relevant listservs. The scholarship shall periodically be promoted through the SCA Newsletter and relevant listservs so that members are aware it may be used for non-SCA events. The application form is available on the SCA website.
3. _Applicant Eligibility_: Eligibility is limited to SCA members in good standing who are students, self employed, unemployed, or whose employers do not financially assist continuing education expenses. Each candidate must submit an application form, including a proposed budget, to be considered for the award. For SCA events there will be a publicized application deadline. The standard deadline for non-SCA events will be established by the Awards Committee and published on its website. The deadline will generally be at least three weeks (21 days) prior to the educational event, but may be adjusted, with new parameters posted online, at the discretion of the committee. Late or incomplete applications will not be considered. Award recipients are not eligible to apply again within the calendar year. Unsuccessful applicants may apply for additional events within the calendar year, with no prejudice. Awards Committee and Education Committee members are not eligible to apply.
4. _Event Eligibility_: This award is for educational events only offered in the state of California, or online educational offerings.
5. _Review Process_:

   a. Candidatesâ€™ applications will be received by the Administrator of the award (typically the Chair of the Awards Committee). The Awards Committee will administer the award and will review applications as received.
   
   b. The Administrator will determine that the applicant has demonstrated need and has appropriately estimated expenses.
   
   c. Upon identifying an award recipient, the Administrator will contact the SCA Membership Director to confirm the active membership status of the candidate. The Administrator will also contact the Treasurer to verify that adequate funds are available.
   
   d. The Administrator will present the application to the Awards Committee for review and approval.
   
   e. The Administrator will inform the award recipient and will notify the Treasurer when the award is accepted. The Administrator will convey that the recipient is responsible for submitting an article for the SCA newsletter to the Awards Committee after the event concludes. In the event that the initial awardee declines the scholarship, the next qualified applicant will be granted the award. Unsuccessful applicants will be notified once the allotted funds are reserved. The scholarship may only be used towards the designated event.

6. _Payment of Scholarship_: Following the education event, the awardee will submit a completed SCA Expense Form, along with receipts, to the award Administrator. The Administrator will sign the expense form and will forward the document to the Treasurer for payment.

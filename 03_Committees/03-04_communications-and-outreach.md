# 3-4 Communications and Outreach Committee

## General Description

This committee exists to facilitate and maintain various means of communication between SCA leadership and members, as well as among SCA members. Such means of communication are focused around but not limited to SCA's website, and could include e-mail blasts, interactive platforms such as social media sites, and electronic tools for reaching out (surveying, educating, etc.) to the membership. The committee works closely with the SCA Board, all other SCA committees, task forces, and groups that wish to communicate to a broad swath of SCA's membership. 

This committee also disseminates information about the archives profession, SCA members and their institutions among the general public; promotes increased diversity within SCA; brings an awareness of the existence and functions of SCA to related professions such as librarians, historians, museum professionals, and records managers, and assists in the publicizing of SCA activities and events. Additionally, because of the particular value in recruiting entry-level professionals, the committee reaches out to student groups, undergraduate history students, and others who might consider archives as a career.

Composition of the committee and terms of office are defined in Handbook section 3-1 and governed by the Bylaws.

Criteria for posting content is the same as posting any content on the homepage: it should be directly relevant to SCA and/or refer to a SCA publication.

### Social Media Posting Policy

# 3-3-9 Advancing Equity: Continuing Education Funding
This funding, established in 2021, promotes the diversification of the larger archival community through the support of continuing education. The award provides financial support to individual archivists of color for archives-related training and professional development, or to organizations proposing educational events for archivists or archives volunteers centered on the records of communities of color.

Community organizations in California, or SCA members in good standing and not enrolled in a degree-granting program, who have limited or no access to institutional funding for continuing education, may apply. Up to $1,000 may be awarded per event, with $2,000 allotted annually for this award.

1. _Intent_: The intent of the scholarship is to promote the diversification of the larger archival community of California by providing financial support for continuing education for archivists of color or for community organizations seeking to provide archival education events benefiting underrepresented communities.
2. _The Award_: a cash amount established each year by the Board will be awarded by check. The maximum award amount established in 2021 is $1,000, with a total of $2,000 budgeted annually.
3. _Publicity_: Notice of award availability will be publicized by the Awards Committee in SCA publications, on the SCA website, and to relevant listservs. The application form will be made available on the SCA website.
4. _Eligibility_:
   - Individual applicants must be SCA members in good standing, not enrolled in a degree-granting program, and have limited or no access to institutional funding for continuing education.

5. _Application Requirements_:
   - Applications must be submitted to the Awards Committee by the deadline published on the SCA Awards website.

Late or incomplete applications will not be considered.
   - Individual applicants must submit an application form, a resume or CV, a personal statement (250-500 words in length) describing how the workshop/class fits into their career path and why outside funding is required, and a letter of recommendation from someone familiar with the applicant's goals in the archival profession.

Following the event, a brief article describing the program should be submitted by the organizers to the SCA Newsletter.
   - _Note: since this award is not tied to a specific event and is available on an ad hoc basis, there is no set application deadline. Applications are considered as-received, and awarded based on the availability of annual funding. If multiple individual applications are received for the same event, or for events in a similar time frame, the Awards Committee will select one or more recipients based on the merits of each application as communicated in the submitted personal statement and letter of recommendation._

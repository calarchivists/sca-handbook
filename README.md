# Handbook, Bylaws, and Policies

The SCA Handbook is intended to be a practical tool outlining the major duties of the officers, Board of Directors, and committees. It provides an up-to-date reference on the Corporation's structure, aims, policies, and procedures.

## 1-1 Handbook Introduction

The Society of California Archivists Handbook is intended to be a practical tool outlining the major duties of the officers, Board of Directors, and committees. It provides an up-to-date reference on the Corporation's structure, aims, policies, and procedures. 
The Handbook is based on the Bylaws of the Corporation, Alice Sturgis’s _The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure_, and ongoing decisions by the Board. Should there be a conflict among these, the Bylaws take precedence, since the Handbook is not binding. 
To maximize the Handbook's usefulness, all Board decisions affecting material in it should be immediately noted by the Secretary. These revisions should be made and updated in the master online copy of the Handbook so that all board members, committee chairs, and the general membership may have access to the most current version via the SCA website.

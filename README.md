# Handbook, Bylaws, and Policies

The SCA Handbook is intended to be a practical tool outlining the major duties of the officers, Board of Directors, and committees. It provides an up-to-date reference on the Corporation's structure, aims, policies, and procedures.

## 1-1 Handbook Introduction

The Society of California Archivists Handbook is intended to be a practical tool outlining the major duties of the officers, Board of Directors, and committees. It provides an up-to-date reference on the Corporation's structure, aims, policies, and procedures. 
The Handbook is based on the Bylaws of the Corporation, Alice Sturgis’s _The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure_, and ongoing decisions by the Board. Should there be a conflict among these, the Bylaws take precedence, since the Handbook is not binding. 
To maximize the Handbook's usefulness, all Board decisions affecting material in it should be immediately noted by the Secretary. These revisions should be made and updated in the master online copy of the Handbook so that all board members, committee chairs, and the general membership may have access to the most current version via the SCA website.

**Statement by the SCA Board affirming SCA's core values**

The Society of California Archivists (SCA) is a non-profit statewide professional organization with a membership of more than 500 archivists and records managers. California’s varied institutions- and the Society’s diverse membership—are committed to the use, preservation, and retention of records.

Our organization cooperates with individuals and other entities on matters of common concern, no matter where the individual or organization is located. SCA supports the position of many of our sister associations, such as the Society of American Archivists, the American Library Association, and others in their strong belief that public notice should be given before removal of any online government information. We stand with our allied organizations in our commitment to offer users free access to information without discrimination.

Our state’s institutions and archivists hold the human record of every race, creed, gender, and religion on earth. We are, at our core, an organization that develops, supports, and promotes archival education to all individuals regardless of national origin, race, orientation, or religion. California’s archival community includes people of color, members of the LGBTQI community, immigrants, religious clergy, and people with disabilities.

The records we hold document the historical past, transform communities, and promote unity and understanding. We value diversity in all its manifestations and look forward to encouraging public interest in, and public support for, archival facilities serving the people of California.

## 1-6 SCA Code of Conduct

The Society of California Archivists (SCA) is devoted to fostering cooperation and professional development among its members. SCA is committed to providing its members and guests with a welcoming, diverse, and professional community. SCA does not tolerate harassment in any form. The Code of Conduct is meant to ensure that those who participate in SCA Programs<sup>1</sup> will not be harassed or in turn harass someone else for any reason. All members and guests are entitled to participate in a professional environment regardless of age, color, creed, disability, family relationship, gender identity, gender expression, individual lifestyle, level of experience in the archival field, marital status, military or veteran status, national origin, physical appearance, professional status, race, class, religion, sex, or sexual orientation.

SCA is committed to combating implicit and explicit bias, and dismantling structural inequities, such as white supremacy, patriarchy, classism, heteronormativity, and ableism. The SCA community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. 

We believe that the best problem-solving and critical thinking happens when people with a wide variety of experiences and perspectives come together to work in comfort as peers. We, therefore, expect participants in the SCA community to help create thoughtful and respectful environments where dialogue and exchange can take place. This policy is not intended to constrain responsible scholarly or professional discourse and debate, but to foster an environment where it can thrive in a universally welcoming community setting. 

SCA will take seriously all good-faith reports of harassment. Harassment may include, but is not limited to, abusive verbal or written comments, unwelcome jokes, discriminatory images, and/or purposeful acts of misgendering in public or online spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact or invasion of physical space; unwelcome sexual attention; and comments that reinforce oppressive power dynamics related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin, or economic status.

Participants in any SCA event or forum, online or offline, who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Those who violate these rules are subject to expulsion from the program or online space. Persons who have been expelled, banned, or otherwise denied access may submit an appeal to the SCA Board.<sup>2</sup>

<sup>1</sup> SCA Programs include conferences, workshops, events, meetings, formal mentoring relationships, and online spaces such as the West_Arch listserv.

<sup>2</sup> The SCA Code of Conduct is reassessed every three years.
